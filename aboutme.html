<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am Stephany Pena, a random person who has created a website for reasons. I enjoy music and I play the violin ever since seventh grade. I like to learn a lot of things like instruments and coding now!. I want to play the saxophone and piano. I enjoy language learning too. I don't know what else to say. To be edited in the future</p>

  <h2>Reflections</h2>
  <p> Scratch has the codes as blocks instead of as long lines of letters. It's like legos while python is writing. Python warns you of the errors and the location while scratch is more guess and check. I wasn't aware of how to fix it until I had to compare especially with pencolor since I typed it as colorpen. You have to be aware of what's written and indenting when it's apart of a function.
  <p> I learned that when the computer looks at a list, the first item is actually labeled as 0 then starts going up the number values. It's also nice on how it could be used as a shortcut. I thought there were groups that managed to get far and those able to make multiple filters were the best to work together and the best to ask help from.
  <p> I think having it set up with the values was hard. I wasn't aware to create the pixels part until someon pointed it out to me. Another challenge was the filter of desire color because the values confused me and the how the signs were used. Until other people presented, I didn't knoe why my picture was being distorted until another group came up and we all talked about it as a wjole group. We used the loop for to recolor the variable which was pixel that was apart of the list. So if it matched the intensity the pixels would changed to the color.I would like to make a filter that could give you pikachu and eevee ears since they are adorable. I liked learning about the filters and how CSS could be created and be used as a seperate sheet.</p>
