<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am Stephany Pena, a random person who has created a website for reasons. I enjoy music and I play the violin ever since seventh grade. I like to learn a lot of things like instruments and coding now!. I want to play the saxophone and piano. I enjoy language learning too. I don't know what else to say. To be edited in the future</p>

  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p> Scratch has the codes as blocks instead of as long lines of letters. It's like legos while python is writing. Python warns you of the errors and the location while scratch is more guess and check. I wasn't aware of how to fix it until I had to compare especially with pencolor since I typed it as colorpen. You have to be aware of what's written and indenting when it's apart of a function.
