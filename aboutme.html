<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am Stephany Pena, a random person who has created a website for reasons. I enjoy music and I play the violin ever since seventh grade. I like to learn a lot of things like instruments and coding now!. I want to play the saxophone and piano. I enjoy language learning too. I don't know what else to say. To be edited in the future</p>

  <h2>Reflections</h2>
  <p> Scratch has the codes as blocks instead of as long lines of letters. It's like legos while python is writing. Python warns you of the errors and the location while scratch is more guess and check. I wasn't aware of how to fix it until I had to compare especially with pencolor since I typed it as colorpen. You have to be aware of what's written and indenting when it's apart of a function.
  <p> I learned that when the computer looks at a list, the first item is actually labeled as 0 then starts going up the number values. It's also nice on how it could be used as a shortcut. I thought there were groups that managed to get far and those able to make multiple filters were the best to work together and the best to ask help from.
  <p> I think having it set up with the values was hard. I wasn't aware to create the pixels part until someon pointed it out to me. Another challenge was the filter of desire color because the values confused me and the how the signs were used. Until other people presented, I didn't know why my picture was being distorted until another group came up and we all talked about it as a wjole group. We used the loop for to recolor the variable which was pixel that was apart of the list. So if it matched the intensity the pixels would changed to the color.I would like to make a filter that could give you pikachu and eevee ears since they are adorable. I liked learning about the filters and how CSS could be created and be used as a seperate sheet.</p>
  <p> Manuela Veloso"s work have in common with Ayanna Howards's work is that they want to develop the human interaction need. Manuela wants robots and humans to co exist which is much brighter than the whole robots replacing humans. Ayanna's is to help humans with diaabilities. We came up with ideas on what we wanted to showcase like morse code and use the lights as a rhythm for a song. I think we could've shared the coding time so it wasn't all on one person. One could had made three light bulbs into seperrate pins and made it that they would light up at different times. There is a current that allows the LED to be lit up.

  <p> I understand that when the resistors, jumper wires, and LED are on the same horizontal row that the circuit would force the current to move. One jumper wire connected two LED light bulbs on the same vertical line because the current is able to move and not treat it as the same current.The beginning was hard because the light didn't want to turn on and it only worked within certain spots on the board.</p>
  <p> I learned that there are types of circuits like series and parallel and that they could connect within each other. I learned jumper wires helped connect amd so did the resistors. I liked the turns we incorporated in the robot in its dance. I think Maneula and Ayanna would need a for loop function if the steps are repeated.
  <p> I learned that there are three sheets that work together and they are html, css and java script. CSS and javascript can be made into external files. I thought that the people who managed to create a button that allowed it to change the background colors. I attempted to do the same and came across a similar code though it didn't create a button it just appeared as one and changed the text and color inside. All of the javascript challenged me except linking the two files together but i researched for each code to see what was similar and different. I think the language LaTeX is a markup language because its used for the text of Math and CS text
